## üîß Structure for Future Projects

This repository is a continuous effort, with new projects being added frequently. Once new projects are completed, they will be added to their own directory within the repository.

Here's a hint for where future projects will be posted:

Each new project will be stored in a new directory following the same naming convention. For example, `Calculator` will go in `Calculator/`, and future projects will continue in this format. The README will also be updated with descriptions and instructions for each new project as they are added.

Stay tuned for more updates!
